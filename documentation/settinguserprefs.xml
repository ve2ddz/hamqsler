	<title>Setting User Preferences</title>
	<para>User preferences control a number of aspects of program execution and contain many text
	and QSOs Box related properties. Depending on some of the user preferences settings,
	HamQSLer may save additional information in the user preferences file. For example, if the setting
	for restoring ADIF files is set, then the paths to all ADIF files that were loaded would be saved
	with the user preferences so that HamQSLer could load these files when the program starts.</para>
	<para>User preferences are written to a text file called <emphasis>.hamqsler</emphasis> and
	stored in the <emphasis>hamqsler</emphasis> directory. This file is loaded during program
	initialization. See the <link linkend="programinit">Program Initialization and the Splash
	Screen</link> chapter for more information.</para>
	<para>Users edit user preferences settings by using the User Preferences dialog. This dialog
	is displayed by selecting the Edit->User Preferences menu item on the main window. When first
	opened, the dialog looks like the image below.</para>

	<para>User preferences are arranged in a set of topics. For example, Program contains settings
	that affect how HamQSLer executes, and TextItems contains settings related to text items. The
	default font face for text items and the default callsign, name and QTH, and salutation that
	are placed on a card when it is first created are examples of texit item settings.</para>
	<para>The box on the left of the dialog contains the set of topics in expander controls. To open
	an expander, either click on the arrowhead to the left of the topic, or double-click on the topic
	name. The image below shows the topics with all expanders opened.</para>

	<para>Clicking on any of the subtopics displays a panel of controls on the right side of the
	dialog. These controls may be set by the user to changed the corresponding user preference.</para>
	<para>Each of the topics and settings is discussed in the sections that follow.</para>

			<title>Program Version Check</title>
			<para>The image below shows the user preferences dialog with the Program
			Version Check subtopic selected. There are only two settings, one for
			checking for new versions of the program and data files, and one for
			also checking for new development releases.</para>

			<para>The Check for Program and Data File Updates checkbox controls whether HamQSLer
			checks for new program and data file versions during initialization. With the
			checkbox checked, the program checks for new versions, and with the checkbox
			unchecked, the program does not check for new versions. The
			default value (the value set when the user preferences file is first created)
			is to check for new versions.</para>
			<para>The Stable and Development Program Releases checkbox determines whether
			HamQSLer should check only for data file updates and stable program
			updates, or if it should also check for development updates. if this checkbox
			is checked, then HamQSLer checks for both stable and development new
			releases during program initialization. If unchecked, HamQSLer checks only 
			for new stable releases. The default value is to not check for development
			versions.</para>
			<para>Development
			versions of HamQSLer are provided to allow users access to new features as they
			are developed rather than waiting for a stable release. You can think of
			development releases as beta releases of the program.</para>
			<para>This checkbox can only be checked or unchecked if the Check for Program
			and Data File Updates checkbox is checked.</para>
			<tip>
				<para>Development releases give users access to new features as they
				are being developed rather than waiting for the final release.</para>
			</tip>
			<caution>
				<para>Development releases have not necessarily been tested as
				thoroughly as stable releases, so more bugs may be encountered in
				a development release that its subsequent stable release. Of course,
				if no one uses the development release, then the bugs won't be found
				until the stable release.</para>
