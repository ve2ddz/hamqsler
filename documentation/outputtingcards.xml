			<title>Print Modes and Printer Margins</title>
			<para>Most printers support two modes of printing: borderless and bordered printing.
			Borderless printing is normally used for printing photographs. The printer increases
			the image size by a few percent to ensure that the image is larger than the paper
			size so that the image being printed completely covers the paper. A small portion
			of the edges of the image are outside the boundaries of the paper. This is
			usually not noticed when you print a photograph, but will be noticeable if
			you print multiple QSL cards in borderless mode, especially if you select a
			cards layout on the page where the one or more cards is positioned at the edges
			of the page. Here is an example of four bureau sized cards printed along
			the top edge of a sheet of letter sized paper in borderless mode.</para>

				</mediaobject>
			</figure>
			<para>Compare the left sides of the cards on the left with the left sides
			of the cards on the right. Notice that the left edge of the cards
			on the left have been clipped. Similarly, the right side of the cards on the
			right have been clipped. Now compare the top edge of the cards at the top with
			the cards on the row below. Again, the top of the cards at the top have been
			clipped. You should only select a borderless paper size if you are centering
			the cards on the page, or are printing on a paper size that is the same size
			as the cards being printed.</para>
			<para>Now, let's look at bordered printing. In this mode, every printer has
			a minimum margin along each edge of the paper. These minimum margins vary from
			printer model to printer model and may not be the same size on each side.
			For example, the HP Officejet 6500 printer has margins of 0.125 inch (3.175 mm)
			on every side; the HP Photosmart 7960 series printers have minimum margins of
			0.125, 0.07, 0.135, and 0.583 inch or 3.175, 1.778, 3.429, and 14.817 mm.
			How do you determine the minimum margins for you printers? HamQSLer
			includes a tool for that. See <link linkend="minimummargins">
			Determining Printer Minimum Margins</link> below.</para>
			<para>Obviously mimimum margins would lead to a problem if you attempted to 
			print cards	using a cards layout that positioned the cards on one or more edges 
			of the page. The edges of the cards that are positioned at the edges of the page
			are clipped, producing a white margin on those edges. Provided the minimum margins are less than
			0.25 inch or 6.35 mm, HamQSLer has a setting that allows you to clip the printing
			around the edges of each card to match the largest minimum margin for the
			printer. See <link linkend="printerprops">Printer Properties and
			Print Properties</link>, below for more information.</para>
		</section>
		<section xml:id="minimummargins">
			<title>Determining Printer Minimum Margins</title>
			<para>As discussed above, printer minimum margins determine where on a page you
			can actually print. HamQSLer provides a tool to enumerate these margins. To open
			the tool, select the Tools -> Show Printer Margins.</para>
			<para>The printer minimum margins dialog opens. The printer dropdown box
			lists all of the printers installed on the user's computer, with the default
			printer selected, and the margins listed below the dropdown. The image below
			shows the result on my computer.</para>

			The value for this margin is displayed in red, and a warning message is shown
			below the margins. The meaning of the message is discussed in the next section.

			<para>The minimum printer margins are a physical property of each printer,
			are set by the printer manufacturer, and are not user changeable.</para>

				<title>Printer Properties</title>
				<para>The printer dropdown box contains a list of all of the printers
				that are installed on the computer. The paper size dropdown box lists all
				of the paper sizes for the selected printer, and the quality dropdown box lists
				all of the print resolution values for the selected printer. Finally, the paper
				source dropdown lists all of the papersources or trays for the selected
				printer. If there is only one paper source, this dropdown box is disabled.
				</para>
				<para>When the user selects a different printer, the paper size, quality,
				and paper source dropdowns are reloaded with the lists that are valid
				for the newly selected printer. An attempt is then made to set the
				selected values to the previously selected values. For example, if the
				paper size for the first printer was selected to be A4, then when a new
				printer is selected, an attempt is make to select A4 as the paper size.
				Similarly, an attempt is made to select the previous quality and paper
				source values. If these values cannot be found in the list, then the
				default paper size, quality, and paper source values for the newly selected
				printer are selected.</para>
				<caution>
					<para>Even though the same paper sizes may exist on multiple printers,
					the name given to these paper sizes may be different. As a result,
					the printer's default paper size would be selected. For example,
					the name for the A4 paper size on the HP OfficeJet 6500 is
					<emphasis>A4 210x297mm</emphasis> and the name on the HP Photosmart
					7960 series of printers is <emphasis>A4</emphasis>. So, even though
					the paper size is A4 in both cases, the names are different, and
					when the user switches between these printers, the default paper
					size would be selected in the paper size dropdown box.</para>
					<para>Similarly, the quality and paper source selected values
					may be set to the newly selected printer's default values.</para>
				</caution>
				<tip>
					<para>The default printer and its default properties may be set in the
					Devices and Printers section of the Control Panel.</para>
				</tip>
				<para>The default printer, paper size, quality, and paper source in the
				user preferences are set to the default computer values when the user
				preference file is created. Any changes made by the user in the user
				preferences dialog are saved to the user preferences file.</para>
				<caution>
					<para>If the printer that is set in user preferences is uninstalled,
					the printer and printer properties will be reset to those for the
					new default printer on the computer.</para>
				</caution>
				<para>When a card is created, the printer and printer properties that
				are stored in user preferences are used to initialize the same values
				for the card.</para>
				<caution>
					<para>If the printer that is set for the card is uninstalled,
					then the printer and printer properties for the card will be reset 
					to those for the new default printer on the computer.</para>
				</caution>
				<para>Finally, when the print dialog is opened during printing, 
				the printer and printer properties in the
				print dialog are set to the values set for the card.</para>
				<para>Set the user preferences printer properties to the values that
				you would normally use for printing QSL cards. There may be instances
				where, for a specific QSL card, you would want to normally print them
				on a different printer or with different printer properties. For example,
				you may have a number of bureau sized QSL cards designed that you would
				print on one printer using either letter or A4 sized cardstock, but also 
				have a 4 inch by 6 inch card that you
				would want to print on a photo printer using 4 inch by 6 inch photo paper
				instead. For this, you would set
				the user preferences to the printer and properties that you will be using
				for most cards, and set the card specific printer and properties of the
				larger card to those for your photo printer.</para>
				<para>Finally, when you print the cards, you can change the printer
				and printer settings again for that specific printer job. One place
				you may want to do this is if you are not at your normal workplace or
				home and want to print some cards using someone else's printer.</para>

			<section>
				<title>Print Properties</title>
				<para>There are four print properties, two of which are related to
				printer margins, and two which are not. We will first look at the two
				that are not affected by print margins.</para>
				<para>The Print Card Outlines checkbox determines whether a black line
				is printed around the edge of the cards. This outline is useful for
				cutting the cards from the cardstock after printing. If the checkbox
				is checked, the outline is printed; if the checkbox is not checked,
				the outline is not printed.</para>
				<para>If this checkbox is checked in the card properties panel, the
				outline is also displayed on the card in design mode.</para>
				<para>When printing a number of cards on cardstock, the total number
				of cards being printed may not be evenly divisible by the number of
				cards per page. If they are not, then the last page being printed would
				contain less than a full page of cards. This is wasteful of cardstock.
				The user may print additional cards with no QSOs printed in the
				QSOs Box on the last page and fill in the QSO data by hand at a later
				time. Filling the last page is accomplished using the Fill Last Page
				With Blank Cards checkbox. With the checkbox checked, the blank cards
				will be printed; with the checkbox unchecked, no blank cards are printed.
				</para>
				<para>Printer margins were discussed in the Print Modes and Printer
				Margins section, above. As mentioned, the printer margins determine how
				close to the edge of a page the printer will print. The first print
				property that is affected by the printer margins is the Set Card
				Margins to Printer Margins checkbox. Checking this checkbox leaves
				a margin around the inside of each card equal to the size of the widest
				margin for the selected printer. With the checkbox unchecked, the contents
				of the card are printed to all edges of the card. This checkbox also
				has an effect in card design mode; if the checkbox is checked, the margin
				is displayed on the card. The image below shows the card created in
				the Getting Started chapter with the Set Card Margins to Printer
				Margins checkbox checked. The Print Card Outlines checkbox was also
				checked to better show the card edges. As you can see, there is a
				clean margin around the inside edges of the card. This margin allows
				the user to print cards out to the edges of the cardstock without
				only one or two edges having margins and without uneven margins.</para>
				<figure xml:id="cardmargins1">
					<title>Card With Printer Margins</title>
					<mediaobject>
						<imageobject>
							<imagedata fileref="images/cardmargins1.png" />
						</imageobject>
					</mediaobject>
				</figure>
				<para>If you want to print cards without a margin, you cannot print to
				the edges of the page. The Print Inside Printer Margins checkbox determines
				whether the cards can be printed to the edges of the cardstock or must
				be printed inside the printer margins. Checking the checkbox forces the
				cards to be printed inside the printer margins; unchecking the checkbox
				allows cards to be printed up to the edges of the cardstock. As you will
				learn in the Print Cards section which follows, unchecking this checkbox
				does not force cards to be printed on the edges of the cardstock. There
				are a number of ways to layout the cards on the cardstock; this setting
				simply allows the user to select a cards layout that prints cards out
				to the edges of the cardstock.</para>
				<para>What happens if the maximum printer margin is large. Have a look at
				the following image.</para>
				<figure xml:id="cardmargins2">
					<title>Card With Large Printer Margins</title>
					<mediaobject>
						<imageobject>
							<imagedata fileref="images/cardmargins2.png" />
						</imageobject>
					</mediaobject>
				</figure>
				<para>In this image, the margins are 14.8 mm or 0.58 inch. As you can see,
				this does not look good at all and there is little space for actual card
				content. For this reason, if the largest printer margin is greater than
				0.25 inch or 6.35 mm, the Print Inside Printer Margins checkbox is checked,
				the Set Card Margins to Printer Margins checkbox is unchecked, and both
				checkboxes are disabled so that the user cannot change their settings.
				This forces cards to be printed with no margins and inside the printer
				margins for the cardstock.</para>

			<title>Printing Cards</title>
			<para>HamQSLer prints cards with QSO information in the QSOs Box on each card.
			If no QSOs are loaded or selected for printing, then a single page of cards
			with no QSO information in the QSOs Box is printed.</para>
			<caution>
				<para>The cards are printed with QSOs in the order that they are sorted
				in the QSOs tab. Be sure to sort the cards in the order you want them
				printed.</para>
			</caution>
			<para>To print cards, the card must be loaded into the program, and the card's
			tab must be selected. That is, the card must be displayed in the program's
			main window.</para>
			<para>Select the Cards -> Print Cards... menu item. This will open the
			print cards dialog which is shown in the image below.</para>

			</figure>
			<para>The printer properties and print properties group boxes are the same
			as in the user preferences dialog and the card properties panel. The values
			in the controls in these group boxes are loaded with same values as the controls
			in the card properties panel. This is the user's last chance to make
			changes to these properties before the cards are printed. Any changes made
			only affect this print job; the card properties are not modified by changes
			made in the print cards dialog.</para>
			<para>There is one additional group box in the dialog: the cards layout
			group box. The radio buttons displayed in this box show how the cards will
			be laid out on the cardstock when they are printed. For each layout, the
			cards are displayed in white with a blue line around them. The area in
			light pink shows the cardstock on which the cards will be printed. In each
			row of layouts, the cards are laid out as follows: top left card is positioned
			at the top left corner of the cardstock, top left card is centered left to
			right and positioned at the top of the cardstock, and finally, the cards are
			printed to be centered on the cardstock. In the image above, the first row
			shows the layouts for cards printed on cardstock in portrait orientation, and
			the second row shows the layouts in landscape orientation.</para>
			<para>If cards cannot be printed on the cardstock in one of the orientations,
			then that row of layouts is not displayed in the dialog. For example, the
			image below shows the cards layout group box for bureau sized cards on
			4 by 6 inch paper. Because the card width is greater than the 4 inches,
			cards cannot be printed on the paper in portrait orientation, so the
			portrait layouts are not shown.</para>

			an example.</para>

			</figure>
			<para>The message "The selected paper size is smaller than the card size. No cards
			can be printed." is displayed in red in the cards layout group box and the Print
			and Preview buttons are disabled.</para>
			<para>As mentioned previously, checking the Print Inside printer Margins checkbox
			affects the layout of cards on the cardstock. The cards are printed so that
			the edges of the cards are at or inside the printer margins. The image below
			shows the layouts for bureau sized cards on letter sized cardstock. It is
			not easy to see, but in portrait mode, the cards in the first two layouts have
			been moved to the left and down.</para>
			<para>There is a much greater effect on the layouts
			in landscape mode. Bureau cards are 5.5 inches wide and letter sized paper is
			11 inches wide in landscape mode. So, two cards can just be printed across
			the paper in landscape mode. However, if the cards are to be printed inside the
			printer margins, then only one card wide can be printed. Compare this image
			to the image in Figure 9.7. The only difference in settings is that the
			Print Inside Printer Margins is checked for Figure 9.10.</para>

			<tip>
				<para>There are three manufacturers of cardstock that is micro-perforated
				for printing of bureau sized cards. In all cases, the cardstock is letter
				sized (8 1/2 by 11 inches). The QSLKit provides cardstock for printing four
				cards per page using the top left or top center landscape layout.
				QslPaper.com provides cardstock for printing four cards per
				page using the center landscape layout. Yourofficestop.com provides
				3UPPCSTOCK cardstock for printing 3 cards per page using the center
				portrait layout.</para>
				<para>Avery provides a number of letter sized, micro-perforated 
				cardstocks for printing four 4.25 by 5.5 inch cards per page.</para>
			</tip>
			<para>The print cards dialog contains three buttons: Print, Preview, and Cancel.
			These buttons perform the expected functions.</para>
			<para>Selecting the Print button prints the cards. A message box, like the one
			in the image below is displayed and updated for each page of cards as
			they are printed. When the last past page is printed, the message
			box disappears.</para>

			<para>Printing is an asynchronous operation. As a print job is performed, the
			output is queued to the printer queue, and control returns to the program.
			Only then will the printer start printing the cards. This has a number of
			advantages:</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>The program does not have to wait for the printer to finish
					printing before it regains control.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Print jobs may be queued to the printer so that the user
					does not have to wait for a print job from another program to
					finish before he can print cards.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Print jobs may be queued to printers that are offline
					(disconnected, powered down, etc.) and the print jobs will remain
					in the queue until the printer is brought online.</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<para>Selecting the Preview button displays the print preview dialog and
			the message box shown in the image above is displayed until the last page
			of cards is processed. The first page of cards is displayed in the print
			preview dialog. For example, the image below shows the print preview dialog
			as displayed if you followed the <link linkend="gettingstarted">Getting 
			Started tutorial</link>.</para>
			<figure xml:id="printpreview1">

				</mediaobject>
			</figure>
			<para>The first thing to notice is that the cards as displayed on the
			page in the dialog are shifted up and to the left by an amount equal to the
			minimum left and top printer margins. This is an artefact of the print
			preview processing. If these cards are printed, they will be positioned
			properly on the cardstock and not as shown in the print preview.</para>
			<para>There are a number of buttons and other controls on the toolbar at the
			top of the dialog. The following table describes what each button and control

		<title>Save Card As JPEG</title>
		<para>A card, with or without QSO data, may be saved as a JPEG file for display
		on a website or for sending over the Internet. To do this, select the Cards ->
		Save Card as Jpeg... menu item. This opens the JPEG Image Properties dialog
		which is shown below.</para>

		<para>The various controls in this dialog set properties of the
		image. If you want to include QSO data in the image, then check the Show QSOs
		checkbox. The card in the image will contain the QSOs that would appear on the 
		first card if you were printing cards.</para>
		<para>The resolution dropdown box contains three commonly used values; 96 DPI
		is the value to use for displaying cards on a computer, such as from a website.
		This corresponds approximately to the typical resolution of a computer monitor,
		so the cards will appear about lifesize on the monitor.
		300 and 600 DPI are good values for printing or for sending to a QSL card printer.
		The dropdown box value is also editable so you can enter any value you want.</para>
		<para>JPEG files use a lossy compression when they are saved, so when a file is
		saved, its quality will decrease somewhat. The quality dropdown box contains a number
		of values that control the amount of compression that is applied when the card
		is saved. Quality values vary between 0 and 100, with 100 being the best
		quality. Even at 100, there is some compression applied.</para>
		<para>There is a link between quality and the size of the image file; the
		higher the quality setting, the larger the file size. For example, take the sample
		card that was created in the <link linkend="gettingstarted">Getting
		Started tutorial</link>. The table below shows the size of the file that
		is created at each of four quality values, with the resolution set to 300 DPI.</para>

			100, yet the file size for an image saved at 100 is more than twice the size
			of the same image saved at 95. The best compromise between image quality and
			file size is 85. The card images that are displayed on the website are saved
			at 85. Some images have been saved two or three times at this quality setting.
			</para>
		</tip>
		<caution>
			<para>If an image is saved as a JPEG, and then loaded into an image editing
			program and resaved multiple times, the quality of the image will gradually
			decrease. However, even with a quality of 85, an image may be resaved a
			few times before there is any discernable loss of quality when the image
			is displayed.</para>
		</caution>
		<tip>
			<para>If you want to have your QSL card added to the sample cards on the website,
			please use the following settings: Show QSOs checked, resolution of 96 DPI,
			quality of 85.  Because of the use of macros in the card, QSOs should be
			printed on the card. You can use the QSOs that are included in the sample.adi 
			file
			in the Samples directory. I promise not to claim credit for any QSOs that are
			included on the card.</para>
