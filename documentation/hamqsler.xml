	   <title>Why Another QSL Design And Print Program</title>
   <para>There are a large number of computer programs available for 
   printing QSL cards. A cross-section of these include:</para>
   <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
	   <listitem>
		   <para>QSO logging programs that print cards, or labels for 
		   affixing to preprinted cards;</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>Programs that print labels for affixing to preprinted

		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>Logging programs that provide DDE capability for 
			import into Microsoft Word or similar programs for printing 
			cards.</para>
		</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
    <para>They are all limited in one way or another and therefore have 
    never satisfied my requirements. Specifically,they either provide 
    limited or no design capability, or only print one QSO per card. 
    They also tend to waste cardstock because they stop printing when 
    the card for the last QSO is printed on the page. I wanted more!</para>
	<para>Have I succeeded? Well, many of my goals have been satisfied. 
	Each future release of this software will provide greater capabilities 
	and let me at least come closer to my desired goal of providing the 
	best QSL design and print program that money can't buy.</para>

			<para>The first steps are to become familiar with
			the <link linkend="splashscreen">HamQSLer splash screen

			depending on certain user preferences, there may be an additional
			tab for each card the next time that you start the program.</para>
			<para>The function tabs select the view that is displayed in 
			the Work Area. The QSOs tab shows the loaded QSOs for which 
			cards may be printed. The QSOs panel, shown in the image below, 
			contains 5 QSOs that have been loaded from an ADIF file, the 
			Sort Cards Panel, and the QSOs filters tabs. The Sort Cards 
			Panel allows you to sort the cards by date and time, by callsign, 
			or by a 
			combination of QSL bureau and manager or callsign. There are
			four QSOs filters tab, each of which contain filters
			for selecting QSOs. The four filters are:</para>

				font. Notice that only this text changed font, not the other
				text items.</para>
				<para>The text may be displayed in Black, Bold, or Normal 
				weight by selecting the weight from the Font Weight combo box.
				Italic or Normal style may be selected by checking and 
				unchecking the
				Italic checkbutton. Try this. For the callsign
				text, the default is normal style and Black weight.</para>
				<para>The size dropdown box contains a number of predefined
				font sizes (in device independent units which are equal
				to Â¾ of a point). 72 is the default value for callsigns.
				You can select any of the sizes
				directly from the list, or edit the size box to enter any
				size that you want. When editing the value, use "." 
				as the decimal separator. Try entering a character other than
				a number or ".". Note the beep emitted by your computer to
				indicate that you entered an invalid character.Now select 
				the font size that you want.</para>
				<para>The color button (the button with the black rectangle)

				or custom colors shown in swatches on the left side of the
				dialog, or you can select a custom color by clicking in the
				rainbow on the right side of the dialog and then adjusting
				the slider to the right of the rainbow to adjust the luminance
				value. Alternatively you may enter hue, saturation and luminance
				values or red, green and blue values in the entry boxes below
				the rainbow. To save as a custom color for later use in the
				program, click on the "Add to Custom Colors" button.</para>
				<para>For this tutorial, a bright orange works best. Set
				red to 255, green to 128, and blue to 0. Save this as a
				custom color because we will be using it again, then click 
				the OK button.
				This closes the color picker dialog. The button in the 
				text item properties panel now displays an orange rectangle,
				and the callsign text on the card is displayed in orange.</para>
				<para>The group box labeled Text holds an edit box containing
				the text of the callsign. Make some changes to the text and
				note that the changes are immediately reflected on the card.
				Reset the text to your callsign.</para>
				<para>Ignore the "Macros" button for now.</para>
				<para>The Checkboxes group box contains four controls, a
				checkbutton for adding a checkbox in front of the text,
				a checkbutton for adding a checkbox after the text, a slider
				for adjusting the thickness of the lines making up the checkboxes,
				and a slider to set the size of the checkboxes as a percentage
				of the height of the text. Adjust each of these controls to see the effect
				they have. The line thickness and check box ratio sliders only
				have an effect when at least
				one of the checkbuttons is checked. Note that the checkboxes
				are displayed in the same color as the text. Uncheck both
				checkbuttons.</para>
				<para>Move the mouse cursor over the callsign text on the
				card. The mouse cursor will change to the move cursor. Press
				and hold the left mouse button, and drag the text to be near
				the top left corner of the card, then release the mouse 
				button.</para>
				<para>Deselect the callsign text and select the text with
				your name and QTH. Change the color of the text to the same
				orange color as the callsign. Adjust the postion of the
				text so that the top of the top line of the text is in
				line with the top of the callsign text. Position the text
				so that it is to the right of the callsign.Deselect the 
				text item.</para>
				<para>Now look at the salutation text on the card. Note
				the text is "Thanks for the QSO$. 73, ". The "&lt;S&gt;" characters
				are a placeholder for a Count Macro. We will look at this
				macro in a moment.</para>
				<para>Select the salutation text item. In the text item
				properties panel, note that Text group box contains only 
				a Macros button. Click on this
				button to open the Text and Macros dialog.</para>
				<para>The Text and Macros dialog will contain three main group boxes:
				the groupbox at the top of the dialog, labelled "Static Text",
				contains a text edit box with the text "Thanks for the QSO",
				The second main group box, labelled "Count Macro" will be discussed
				in a moment. The third main group box located at the bottom of
				the dialog is labelled "Static Text" and contains a text edit
				box with the text ". 73," in it. The dialog will look like

				<para>The Count Macro group box
				contains controls for the contents of a Count Macro. A Count
				Macro displays text based on the number of QSOs rows that
				are printed in the QSOs Box for cards with no QSOs, and 
				the number of QSOs printed for cards with QSOs. This count 
				macro is set up to print "s" when the QSOs count is greater
				than one, print nothing when the QSOs count is 1, and to
				display
				"&lt;S&gt;" on the card in design mode. Each of these values, and
				the condition may be modified. See the 
				<link linkend="macros">Macros chapter</link> for
				more information. We will not make any changes to the

				<para>The text that is displayed in the Qsos Box (e.g. the
				confirming text (in the top line of the box, the text for
				each column header, and the text that is displayed in the 
				QSL column, not yet shown on the card) is determined by 
				user preferences and is fixed when the card is first created.
				See the <link linkend="settinguserprefs">User 
				Preferences</link> chapter for details on setting these
				values.</para>
				<section>
					<title>Setting QSOs and Fields Properties</title>
					<para>Let's look at each property. The Show Manager checkbox
					when checked adds the text "via ZZZZZZ" to the confirmation
					line in design mode, and will replace "ZZZZZZ" with the
					other station's QSL manager if one exists and is included
					in the Manager column of the QSOs printed on the card. We
					will look at this later when we select the QSOs to be printed.
					If no manager exists, the text, including "via" is not
					printed. Check this checkbox as we will be using it later.</para>
					<para>Below the Show Manager checkbox are two radio buttons,
					one labeled "Show Band Column" and the other labeled 
					"Show Frequency Column". When
					you create a card, the "Show Band Column" radio button 
					is selected by
					default. These two radio buttons determine whether the 
					Qsos Box displays a band column or a frequency column. Click
					the "Show Frequency Column" button. 
					Note that the Band column header
					has changed to MHz and that the size of the various columns
					have adjusted themselves.</para>
					<para>What happens if you select the Band radio button but
					your logging program only logs frequency? When the ADIF file
					containing the QSOs is loaded, or when you manually input
					QSOs, a band field will be generated
					for each QSO, with the band corresponding to the band
					containing the logged frequency.</para>
					<para>And what happens if you select the Frequency radio
					button but the QSO only has a band field and not a frequency
					field? When each card is printed, a default frequency for
					that band is substituted. The default frequency for each
					band may be set in the user preferences.</para>
					<para>Make sure that the "Show Band Column" radio button 
					is selected.</para>
					<para>The QSL Pse/Tnx checkbox controls the visibility of
					the QSL column in the Qsos Box. When a card is first created,
					this checkbox is checked. Uncheck the checkbox; note that
					the column labeled "QSL" at the left of the
					Qsos Box has been removed, and the other columns have been 
					resized. The values
					printed in this column depend on the value of the QSL_RCVD
					ADIF field for each QSO. If the field contains "Y" indicating
					that a QSL card has been received confirming this QSO, then
					the text "Tnx" is printed in the column for that QSO. If
					the column contains any other value, the text "Pse" is printed
					in the column. "Tnx" and "Pse" are default values; they may
					be changed in user preferences.</para>
					<para>Make sure that the checkbox is checked before continuing
					with this tutorial.</para>
					<para>The Date Format dropdown box contains three values:
					</para>
					<simplelist type="vert">
						<member>YYYY-MM-DD</member>
						<member>DD-MMM-YY</member>
						<member>DD-MM-YY</member>
					</simplelist>
					<para>The value selected determines both the text that is
					displayed in the date column, and the format of the date printed
					for each QSO. Change to a different value to see the effect on
					the Qsos Box. Finally, set this value to YYYY-MM-DD for this
					tutorial.</para>
					<para>The Max Qsos control specifies the maximum number of
					QSOs that may be printed on the card. The control is an
					editable spinner; you may change values by clicking on the
					up or down triangles on the right side of the control, or
					you may directly edit the value. Valid values are between
					1 and 15. Try multiple values to see how the Qsos Box changes.
					</para>
					<para>The default value when you create a new card is 4.
					There is no way to change this default.</para>
					<para>Finally, set this value to 2.</para>
				</section>
				<section>
					<title>Setting Line and Text Properties</title>
					<para>There are three color buttons. Each button opens the
					color picker dialog to allow you to select a color. The three
					colors control the color of the lines and text in the Qsos
					Box, the color of the callsign in the confirming text, and
					the color of the manager in the confirming text. Set the
					line and text color to orange (red=255, green=128, blue=0),
					and set the manager color to green (red=0, green=255,
					blue=0). The orange text is a bit hard to read but we will
					fix that in a moment.</para>
					<para>The Font Size dropdown box contains values between
					8.0 and 14.0. This sets the size of the font in the QSOs
					Box. Try different values. For the 2 QSOs that we have set
					as the maximum, a value of 12.0 points is good. Smaller 
					values will
					be needed when you select a large Max QSOs value; otherwise
					the box would not fit on the card.</para>
					<para>The Font dropdown box allows you to select the font
					that the text in the Qsos Box is displayed and printed in.
					The initial font selected in the dropdown box is the font
					that you specified as the default QSOs Box font in the
					User Preferences earlier.
					Select a few different fonts and notice how the height of
					the Qsos Box changes. The actual height of a line of text
					in each font will be different, even though the font size
					has not changed.</para>
					<para>Set the font to a value that looks good to you.</para>
				</section>
				<section>
					<title>Setting Qsos Box Background Properties</title>
					<para>These properties control the color and the opacity
					(opposite of transparency) of the background of the Qsos
					Box.</para>
					<para>Click on the Color button to display the color picker
					dialog. This dialog may be used to change the color of the
					background of the Qsos Box. Note that any change you make
					is not visible. We will correct that in a moment.</para>
					<para>The opacity slider adjusts the opacity 
					(1 - transparency) of the background. Adjust the slider to
					select values between 0 and 100% to see the effect on the
					Qsos Box.</para>
					<para>When you have finished playing, set the color to black
					(red=0, green=0, blue=0), and set the opacity to 30%. Note
					that the orange text in the Qsos Box is now much more visible,
					and that a considerable amount of the detail in the

				<para>The card layout group box on the left of the dialog allows
				you to select how the cards are printed on the page. Depending
				on the size of the paper you selected in the Printing Preferences
				dialog and the size of the cards you will be printing, there
				will be up to six choices. The layouts shown in the figure above
				are for bureau sized cards on letter sized (8Â½ by 11 inch) paper.
				The cards are shown in white with a blue edge and the paper
				or cardstock is shown in light pink so you can see how the cards
				are layed out. For this tutorial, select the layout at the top
				left.</para>
				<para>The Options group box on the right of the Print Settings
				dialog controls certain print options:</para>
				<para>The Print Card Outlines checkbox controls whether a black
				line is printed around the edges of each card. Printing the card
				outline makes it easier to cut the cards out of the cardstock.</para>
				<para>If the number of cards to be printed does not exactly
				equal the number of pages to be printed multiplied by the number
				of cards per page, then a portion of the last page would be
				wasted. In this tutorial for example, four cards would be printed
				at three cards per page. In order not to waste a portion of the
				cardstock, you may print "blank" cards to fill the rest of the
				page. These blank cards contain no QSO information; you may enter
				this information using a pen at a later time. Printing or not
				printing these blank cards is controlled by the Fill Last Page
				With Blank Cards checkbox.</para>
				<para>Unless you selected a borderless page size, then your printer
				will not print to the edge of the cardstock, but will leave margins
				of different sizes around the edges of the cardstock when you
				print the cards. Because you will be printing multiple cards
				per page, the cards would have unequal, unprinted margins along one or
				more sides of each card. To create equal sized margins around the
				edges of each card, check the Set Card Margins to Printer Page
				Margins checkbox. Depending on card layout that you choose, this
				checkbox may be checked or unchecked. For this tutorial, make
				sure that this checkbox is checked.</para>
				<para>Please note: if you are using a printer that does not
				provide its margin information, this checkbox will be unchecked
				and disabled, so you will not be able to check it. After you
				clicked the "Print" button on the Print dialog, a message dialog
				will have been displayed to inform you of this.</para>

			<title>Introduction to Macros</title>
			<para>Macros add a powerful feature to HamQSLer by providing
			<emphasis>active</emphasis> text. For every macro there is text
			that is displayed on the card in design view, and text that is
			inserted when the cards are printed. These macros may be used
			in any text item and also in the confirming text user preference.
			If you followed the Getting
			Started Tutorial, you got your first glimpse of Count Macro.</para>
			<para>This discussion will focus on macros used in text items;
			using macros in the confirming text user preference are similar
			to macros within the Text and Macros dialog which you
			will see shortly.</para>
			<para>The image below shows the text area in a text item properties
			panel. If there are no macros used in the text item, then this
			is what you will see: a text box for editing the static text,
			and a button labeled "Macros". If there are macros
			being used in the text item, then only the button is visible.</para>

			<para>Clicking the button opens the Text and Macros dialog, shown

			<para>To add a macro, place the mouse cursor over the colored
			rectangle that contains the "Static Text" and click the right 
			mouse button to bring up the macros
			context menu, shown below.</para>

					</imageobject>
				</mediaobject>
			</figure>
			<para>The context menu permits you to add a macro either before
			or after the static text or macro colored rectangle you opened the
			context menu over. There are a few things to notice:</para>
			<simplelist>
				<member>The Delete menu item cannot be selected when only
				one static text or macro exists.</member>
				<member>Static text items cannot be inserted next to another
				static text item, only next to macros.</member>
			</simplelist>
			<para>The image below shows the dialog after a Manager Macro has
			been inserted after the static text item, and all expanders have
			been expanded.</para>

			</figure>
			<para>Every macro has a section called "Design Text". This is
			the text that is displayed on the card in design mode. In the
			Getting Started Tutorial, this is the "&lt;S&gt;" in both the confirming
			text in the QSOs Box and in the salutation text item. Other sections
			are specific to the macros. At print time, the Manager Macro
			will place the contents of the Manager field for the QSO on the
			card, or the No Manager Text if the Manager field is empty.
			Any of these fields may be blank.</para>
			<para>Macros may be inserted inside macros anywhere that a static
			text field is allowed. For example, you could add a macro inside
			the Design Text or No Manager Text fields of the Manager Macro,
			but you could not add another macro at the same level as the
			Design Text or No Manager Text sections. While macros may theoretically
			be added to any depth, you should take great care with this facility
			as keeping track of the macro level becomes increasingly difficult
			as macros are added to greater depths.</para>
			<para>The remaining sections in this chapter describe each macro.</para>

		<section>
			<title>ADIF Macro</title>
			<para>An ADIF Macro prints the contents of an ADIF field on a
			card if the field exists and is not an empty string; otherwise,
			it prints user specified text. The image below shows a view of 
			the ADIF Macro as it would first appear after adding in the
			Text and Macros dialog.</para>
			<figure xml:id="adifmacro">

						<imagedata fileref="images/adifmacro.png" />
					</imageobject>
				</mediaobject>
			</figure>
			<para>The contents of an ADIF field may change from one QSO to
			the next. Because of this, you will normally want to print a
			different card every time the contents of the ADIF field changes.
			Checking the "Separate Cards By This ADIF Field" checkbox will
			do this; if you do not check this checkbox, then the contents
			of the ADIF field from the first QSO that is printed on the card
			will be added to the card.</para>
			<para>Add the name of the ADIF field for this macro to the ADIF
			Field text box. Standard ADIF fields are defined in the ADIF
			standard, available at <link xlink:href="http://www.adif.org">
			http://www.adif.org</link>. Be sure to select the
			version of the standard that corresponds to the version specified by
			your logging application. In addition to the fields defined in the
			standard, your logger may also export application specific fields.
			See the documentation for your logger for these fields.</para>
			<para>The field name is not case sensitive; for example, "CALL",
			"call", and "CalL" are all valid.</para>
			<para>The No Field Text section contains the text that would
			be printed if either the ADIF field does not exist for the QSOs,
			or the value of the field is an empty string.</para>
			<tip>
				<para>Do you operate using a number of different callsigns?
				If you do and your exported ADIF file contains the 
				STATION_CALLSIGN field, then you could replace the static
				callsign text item with an ADIF Macro for the STATION_CALLSIGN.
				Be sure to check the "Separate Cards By This ADIF Field"
				checkbox. Then a single card can be used for every one of
				your callsigns.</para>
			</tip>
			<tip>
				<para>QSL bureaus prefer that the callsign of the station
				that is to receive a QSL card be written in the upper right
				or left corner of the back or front of the card. You could
				do this by adding a new text item, positioning it appropriately,
				and including text such as "To: " as well as an ADIF macro
				for the CALL field.</para>
				<para>HamQSLer does not easily support printing
				this on the opposite side of the card from other text and
				the QSOs Box, but if you properly design your card, it can
				be placed on the same side as these items and still be very
				visible to the sorters at the QSL bureaus.</para>
			</tip>
			<tip>
				<para>You could customize the confirming text in the QSOs
				Box or the salutation text item to contain mode information.
				For example, your salutation could be "Thanks for the CW
				QSOs. 73, " for CW QSOs and so forth.</para>
			</tip>

		<section>
			<title>ADIF Exists Macro</title>
			<para>The ADIF Exists Macro prints user specified text if the
			ADIF field exists for a QSO and its contents are not an empty 
			string, and
			prints a different user specified text if the field either does
			not exist or the field contents are empty. The image below shows 
			a view of the ADIF Exists Macro.</para>
			<para>This image shows the various sections
			as they would be immediately after the macro has been added to

			<para>Enter the text that you want displayed if the ADIF field
			doesn't exist in the Field Doesn't Exist Text section.</para>
			<tip>
				<para>If you are a contester, you could use this macro to
				modify the salutation to say "Thanks for the contest QSOs.
				73, " for cards for your contest QSOs and not include the
				"contest" word for non-contest QSOs.</para>

		<section>
			<title>Count Macro</title>
			<para>The Count Macro specifies text that is to be printed when
			the condition is met and text that is printed when the condition
			is not met. When a card with QSOs in the QSOs Box is printed,
			the condition is tested against the number of QSOs being  printed
			in the QSOs Box. If a blank card (i.e. a card without QSOs) is
			printed, the condition is tested against the max QSOs count for
			the QSOs Box. This matches the number of blank rows printed on
			the card.</para>
			<para>The image below shows a view of the Count Macro. This image 
			shows the various sections
			as they would be immediately after the macro has been added to
			the Text and Macros dialog.</para>

			<para>The Condition radio buttons set the test that is to be
			performed against the Condition Value. The conditions are:</para>
			<simplelist>
				<member>Equals,</member>
				<member>Less than, and</member>
				<member>Greater than.</member>
			</simplelist>
			<para>The Condition Value is the number of QSOs or the max QSOs
			value for the QSOs Box. This value may be set to any value between
			1 and 15, and matches the range of values allowed for max QSOs.</para>
			<para>Enter the text you want to be displayed on the card in
			design mode in the Design Text section.</para>
			<para>Enter the text that is to be printed when the condition
			is met in the True Text section. This is the "&lt;S&gt;" text that is
			displayed in the confirming text and the salutation text as set
			in the original user preferences.</para>
			<para>Enter the text that is to be printed when the condition
			is not met in the False Text section.</para>
			<para>You may reverse conditions by reversing the True Text and
			False Text texts.</para>
			<tip>
				<para>The confirming text in the QSOs Box and the salutation
				text defined in the original user preferences (set when you
				start HamQSLer for the first time) each contain a Count Macro.
				As used there, the design text is "&lt;S&gt;", "s" is printed when
				the number of QSOs (or the max QSOs count for blank cards)
				is greater than 1 and no text is printed when the number of
				QSOs is 1.</para>
				<para>It would appear that the use of this macro is limited
				to cases such as this.</para>

			<title>Manager Macro</title>

<para><emphasis role="bold">0. PREAMBLE</emphasis></para>
<para>
The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other 
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure
everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or 
without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. 
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way 
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
 modifications made by others.</para>
<para>
This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works 
of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It 
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license 
designed for free software.</para>
<para>
We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free 
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program
 should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software 
 does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be 
 used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it 
 is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally 
 for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.</para>
 
<para><emphasis role="bold">1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</emphasis></para>
<para>
This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that 
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be 
distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a 
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that 
work under the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers 
to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and 
is addressed as "you". You accept the license if you copy, modify or 
distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.
</para>
<para>
A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the 
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with 
modifications and/or translated into another language.
</para>
<para>
A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of 
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the 
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject 
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly 
within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a 
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any 
mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical 
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, 
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.
</para>
<para>
The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that 
says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does
not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be 
designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant 
Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then 
there are none.</para>
<para>
The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the 
Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at 
most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.</para>
<para>
A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, 
represented in a format whose specification is available to the general 
public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly 
with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic 
paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, 
and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic 
translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text 
formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose 
markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage 
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format 
is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy 
that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</para>
<para>
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII 
without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML 
using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, 
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of 
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats 
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by 
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or 
processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated 
HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output 
purposes only.</para>
<para>
The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus 
such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this 
License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which
do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the
most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning 
of the body of the text.</para>
<para>
The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of 
the Document to the public.</para>
<para>
A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose 
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following 
text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a 
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements", 
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of
such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a 
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.</para>
<para>
The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which 
states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty 
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, 
but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that 
these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the 
meaning of this License.</para>

<para><emphasis role="bold">2. VERBATIM COPYING</emphasis></para>
<para>
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either 
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the 
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to
the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other 
conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use 
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying
of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept 
compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough 
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
</para>
<para>
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and 
you may publicly display copies.</para>

<para><emphasis role="bold">3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</emphasis></para>
<para>
If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have 
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the 
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the 
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back 
cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the 
publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title 
with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add 
other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited 
to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and 
satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other 
respects.</para>
<para>
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit 
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit 
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent 
pages.</para>
<para>
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering 
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent 
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
computer-network location from which the general network-using public 
has access to download using public-standard network protocols a 
complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If 
you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when 
you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location 
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque 
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to 
the public.</para>
<para>x
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the 
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give 
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
</para>
<para><emphasis role="bold">4. MODIFICATIONS</emphasis></para>
<para>
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the

filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and 
modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. 
In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:</para>

    Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title 
       distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous 
       versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the 
       History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a
       previous version if the original publisher of that version gives

       If there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create

       the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.</para>

    Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for 
       public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
       the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
       it was based on. These may be placed in the "History" section. 
       You may omit a network location for a work that was published at 
       least four years before the Document itself, or if the original 
       publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.</para>

</orderedlist>
<para>
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices
that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from 
the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these 
sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of 
Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These 
titles must be distinct from any other section titles.</para>
<para>
You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains 
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various partiesâfor
example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by
an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.</para>
<para>
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a 
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list 
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover 
Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements
made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text 
for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by 
the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; 
but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the 
previous publisher that added the old one.</para>
<para>
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License 
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or 
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</para>

<para><emphasis role="bold">5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</emphasis></para>
<para>
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this 
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified 
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the 
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and 
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license
notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.</para>
<para>
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and 
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single 
copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but 
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding
at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or 
publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the 
same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections 
in the license notice of the combined work.</para>
<para>
In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History" in 
the various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History"; 
likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", and any 
sections Entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections Entitled 
"Endorsements".</para>

<para><emphasis role="bold">6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</emphasis></para>
<para>
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this 
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in 
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for 
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.</para>
<para>
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this 
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all 
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.</para>

<para><emphasis role="bold">7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
</emphasis></para>
<para>
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or 
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting
from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the 
compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the 
Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the
other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works 
of the Document.</para>
<para>
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies
of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the 
entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers 
that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic 
equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise 
they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.
</para>
<para><emphasis role="bold">8. TRANSLATION</emphasis></para>
<para>
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute 
translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing 
Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from 
their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all
Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these 
Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and 
all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, 
provided that you also include the original English version of this 
License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In 
case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version 
of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will 
prevail.</para>
<para>
If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements", 
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its
Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.
</para>
<para><emphasis role="bold">9. TERMINATION</emphasis></para>
<para>
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except 
as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically 
terminate your rights under this License.</para>
<para>
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license 
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, 
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates 
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to 
notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days 
after the cessation.</para>
<para>
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated 
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by 
some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice 
of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, 
and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the 
notice.</para>
<para>
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the 
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under 
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently 
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does 
not give you any rights to use it.</para>

<para><emphasis role="bold">10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
</emphasis></para>
<para>
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the 
GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
</para>
<para>
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If
the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this 
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of 
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or 
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the 
Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version 
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not 
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies 
that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be 
used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version 
permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.
</para>
<para><emphasis role="bold">11. RELICENSING</emphasis></para>
<para>
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any World
Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides 
prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that
anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A "Massive Multiauthor 
Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site means any set of 
copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.</para>
<para>
"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit 
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, 
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license 
published by that same organization.</para>
<para>
"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in 
part, as part of another Document.</para>
<para>
An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this 
License, and if all works that were first published under this License 
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or
in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and 
(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.</para>
<para>
The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site 
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, 
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.</para>

<para><emphasis role="bold">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your 
documents</emphasis></para>
<para>
To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of 
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license 
notices just after the title page:</para>

    <literallayout>    Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this 
    document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, 
    Version 1.3 or any later version published by the Free Software 
    Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no
    Back-Cover Texts.
    
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
    Free Documentation License".</literallayout>

<para>
If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, 
replace the "with â¦ Texts." line with this:</para>
<literallayout>
    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being
    LIST.</literallayout>

<para>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other 
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the 
situation.</para>
<para>
If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we 
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit 
their use in free software.</para>
