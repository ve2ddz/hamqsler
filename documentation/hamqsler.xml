	   <title>Why Another QSL Design And Print Program</title>
   <para>There are a large number of computer programs available for 
   printing QSL cards. A cross-section of these include:</para>
   <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
	   <listitem>
		   <para>QSO logging programs that print cards, or labels for 
		   affixing to preprinted cards;</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>Programs that print labels for affixing to preprinted

		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>Logging programs that provide DDE capability for 
			import into Microsoft Word or similar programs for printing 
			cards.</para>
		</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
    <para>They are all limited in one way or another and therefore have 
    never satisfied my requirements. Specifically,they either provide 
    limited or no design capability, or only print one QSO per card. 
    They also tend to waste cardstock because they stop printing when 
    the card for the last QSO is printed on the page. I wanted more!</para>
	<para>Have I succeeded? Well, many of my goals have been satisfied. 
	Each future release of this software will provide greater capabilities 
	and let me at least come closer to my desired goal of providing the 
	best QSL design and print program that money can't buy.</para>

			<para>The first steps are to become familiar with
			the <link linkend="splashscreen">HamQSLer splash screen

			depending on certain user preferences, there may be an additional
			tab for each card the next time that you start the program.</para>
			<para>The function tabs select the view that is displayed in 
			the Work Area. The QSOs tab shows the loaded QSOs for which 
			cards may be printed. The QSOs panel, shown in the image below, 
			contains 5 QSOs that have been loaded from an ADIF file, the 
			Sort Cards Panel, and the QSOs filters tabs. The Sort Cards 
			Panel allows you to sort the cards by date and time, by callsign, 
			or by a 
			combination of QSL bureau and manager or callsign. There are
			four QSOs filters tab, each of which contain filters
			for selecting QSOs. The four filters are:</para>

				font. Notice that only this text changed font, not the other
				text items.</para>
				<para>The text may be displayed in Black, Bold, or Normal 
				weight by selecting the weight from the Font Weight combo box.
				Italic or Normal style may be selected by checking and 
				unchecking the
				Italic checkbutton. Try this. For the callsign
				text, the default is normal style and Black weight.</para>
				<para>The size dropdown box contains a number of predefined
				font sizes (in device independent units which are equal
				to Â¾ of a point). 72 is the default value for callsigns.
				You can select any of the sizes
				directly from the list, or edit the size box to enter any
				size that you want. When editing the value, use "." 
				as the decimal separator. Try entering a character other than
				a number or ".". Note the beep emitted by your computer to
				indicate that you entered an invalid character.Now select 
				the font size that you want.</para>
				<para>The color button (the button with the black rectangle)

				or custom colors shown in swatches on the left side of the
				dialog, or you can select a custom color by clicking in the
				rainbow on the right side of the dialog and then adjusting
				the slider to the right of the rainbow to adjust the luminance
				value. Alternatively you may enter hue, saturation and luminance
				values or red, green and blue values in the entry boxes below
				the rainbow. To save as a custom color for later use in the
				program, click on the "Add to Custom Colors" button.</para>
				<para>For this tutorial, a bright orange works best. Set
				red to 255, green to 128, and blue to 0. Save this as a
				custom color because we will be using it again, then click 
				the OK button.
				This closes the color picker dialog. The button in the 
				text item properties panel now displays an orange rectangle,
				and the callsign text on the card is displayed in orange.</para>
				<para>The group box labeled Text holds an edit box containing
				the text of the callsign. Make some changes to the text and
				note that the changes are immediately reflected on the card.
				Reset the text to your callsign.</para>
				<para>Ignore the "Macros" button for now.</para>
				<para>The Checkboxes group box contains four controls, a
				checkbutton for adding a checkbox in front of the text,
				a checkbutton for adding a checkbox after the text, a slider
				for adjusting the thickness of the lines making up the checkboxes,
				and a slider to set the size of the checkboxes as a percentage
				of the height of the text. Adjust each of these controls to see the effect
				they have. The line thickness and check box ratio sliders only
				have an effect when at least
				one of the checkbuttons is checked. Note that the checkboxes
				are displayed in the same color as the text. Uncheck both
				checkbuttons.</para>
				<para>Move the mouse cursor over the callsign text on the
				card. The mouse cursor will change to the move cursor. Press
				and hold the left mouse button, and drag the text to be near
				the top left corner of the card, then release the mouse 
				button.</para>
				<para>Deselect the callsign text and select the text with
				your name and QTH. Change the color of the text to the same
				orange color as the callsign. Adjust the postion of the
				text so that the top of the top line of the text is in
				line with the top of the callsign text. Position the text
				so that it is to the right of the callsign.Deselect the 
				text item.</para>
				<para>Now look at the salutation text on the card. Note
				the text is "Thanks for the QSO$. 73, ". The "&lt;S&gt;" characters
				are a placeholder for a Count Macro. We will look at this
				macro in a moment.</para>
				<para>Select the salutation text item. In the text item
				properties panel, note that Text group box contains only 
				a Macros button. Click on this
				button to open the Text and Macros dialog.</para>
				<para>The Text and Macros dialog will contain three main group boxes:
				the groupbox at the top of the dialog, labelled "Static Text",
				contains a text edit box with the text "Thanks for the QSO",
				The second main group box, labelled "Count Macro" will be discussed
				in a moment. The third main group box located at the bottom of
				the dialog is labelled "Static Text" and contains a text edit
				box with the text ". 73," in it. The dialog will look like

				<para>The Count Macro group box
				contains controls for the contents of a Count Macro. A Count
				Macro displays text based on the number of QSOs rows that
				are printed in the QSOs Box for cards with no QSOs, and 
				the number of QSOs printed for cards with QSOs. This count 
				macro is set up to print "s" when the QSOs count is greater
				than one, print nothing when the QSOs count is 1, and to
				display
				"&lt;S&gt;" on the card in design mode. Each of these values, and
				the condition may be modified. See the 
				<link linkend="macros">Macros chapter</link> for
				more information. We will not make any changes to the

				<para>The text that is displayed in the Qsos Box (e.g. the
				confirming text (in the top line of the box, the text for
				each column header, and the text that is displayed in the 
				QSL column, not yet shown on the card) is determined by 
				user preferences and is fixed when the card is first created.
				See the <link linkend="settinguserprefs">User 
				Preferences</link> chapter for details on setting these
				values.</para>
				<section>
					<title>Setting QSOs and Fields Properties</title>
					<para>Let's look at each property. The Show Manager checkbox
					when checked adds the text "via ZZZZZZ" to the confirmation
					line in design mode, and will replace "ZZZZZZ" with the
					other station's QSL manager if one exists and is included
					in the Manager column of the QSOs printed on the card. We
					will look at this later when we select the QSOs to be printed.
					If no manager exists, the text, including "via" is not
					printed. Check this checkbox as we will be using it later.</para>
					<para>Below the Show Manager checkbox are two radio buttons,
					one labeled "Show Band Column" and the other labeled 
					"Show Frequency Column". When
					you create a card, the "Show Band Column" radio button 
					is selected by
					default. These two radio buttons determine whether the 
					Qsos Box displays a band column or a frequency column. Click
					the "Show Frequency Column" button. 
					Note that the Band column header
					has changed to MHz and that the size of the various columns
					have adjusted themselves.</para>
					<para>What happens if you select the Band radio button but
					your logging program only logs frequency? When the ADIF file
					containing the QSOs is loaded, or when you manually input
					QSOs, a band field will be generated
					for each QSO, with the band corresponding to the band
					containing the logged frequency.</para>
					<para>And what happens if you select the Frequency radio
					button but the QSO only has a band field and not a frequency
					field? When each card is printed, a default frequency for
					that band is substituted. The default frequency for each
					band may be set in the user preferences.</para>
					<para>Make sure that the "Show Band Column" radio button 
					is selected.</para>
					<para>The QSL Pse/Tnx checkbox controls the visibility of
					the QSL column in the Qsos Box. When a card is first created,
					this checkbox is checked. Uncheck the checkbox; note that
					the column labeled "QSL" at the left of the
					Qsos Box has been removed, and the other columns have been 
					resized. The values
					printed in this column depend on the value of the QSL_RCVD
					ADIF field for each QSO. If the field contains "Y" indicating
					that a QSL card has been received confirming this QSO, then
					the text "Tnx" is printed in the column for that QSO. If
					the column contains any other value, the text "Pse" is printed
					in the column. "Tnx" and "Pse" are default values; they may
					be changed in user preferences.</para>
					<para>Make sure that the checkbox is checked before continuing
					with this tutorial.</para>
					<para>The Date Format dropdown box contains three values:
					</para>
					<simplelist type="vert">
						<member>YYYY-MM-DD</member>
						<member>DD-MMM-YY</member>
						<member>DD-MM-YY</member>
					</simplelist>
					<para>The value selected determines both the text that is
					displayed in the date column, and the format of the date printed
					for each QSO. Change to a different value to see the effect on
					the Qsos Box. Finally, set this value to YYYY-MM-DD for this
					tutorial.</para>
					<para>The Max Qsos control specifies the maximum number of
					QSOs that may be printed on the card. The control is an
					editable spinner; you may change values by clicking on the
					up or down triangles on the right side of the control, or
					you may directly edit the value. Valid values are between
					1 and 15. Try multiple values to see how the Qsos Box changes.
					</para>
					<para>The default value when you create a new card is 4.
					There is no way to change this default.</para>
					<para>Finally, set this value to 2.</para>
				</section>
				<section>
					<title>Setting Line and Text Properties</title>
					<para>There are three color buttons. Each button opens the
					color picker dialog to allow you to select a color. The three
					colors control the color of the lines and text in the Qsos
					Box, the color of the callsign in the confirming text, and
					the color of the manager in the confirming text. Set the
					line and text color to orange (red=255, green=128, blue=0),
					and set the manager color to green (red=0, green=255,
					blue=0). The orange text is a bit hard to read but we will
					fix that in a moment.</para>
					<para>The Font Size dropdown box contains values between
					8.0 and 14.0. This sets the size of the font in the QSOs
					Box. Try different values. For the 2 QSOs that we have set
					as the maximum, a value of 12.0 points is good. Smaller 
					values will
					be needed when you select a large Max QSOs value; otherwise
					the box would not fit on the card.</para>
					<para>The Font dropdown box allows you to select the font
					that the text in the Qsos Box is displayed and printed in.
					The initial font selected in the dropdown box is the font
					that you specified as the default QSOs Box font in the
					User Preferences earlier.
					Select a few different fonts and notice how the height of
					the Qsos Box changes. The actual height of a line of text
					in each font will be different, even though the font size
					has not changed.</para>
					<para>Set the font to a value that looks good to you.</para>
				</section>
				<section>
					<title>Setting Qsos Box Background Properties</title>
					<para>These properties control the color and the opacity
					(opposite of transparency) of the background of the Qsos
					Box.</para>
					<para>Click on the Color button to display the color picker
					dialog. This dialog may be used to change the color of the
					background of the Qsos Box. Note that any change you make
					is not visible. We will correct that in a moment.</para>
					<para>The opacity slider adjusts the opacity 
					(1 - transparency) of the background. Adjust the slider to
					select values between 0 and 100% to see the effect on the
					Qsos Box.</para>
					<para>When you have finished playing, set the color to black
					(red=0, green=0, blue=0), and set the opacity to 30%. Note
					that the orange text in the Qsos Box is now much more visible,
					and that a considerable amount of the detail in the

				<para>The card layout group box on the left of the dialog allows
				you to select how the cards are printed on the page. Depending
				on the size of the paper you selected in the Printing Preferences
				dialog and the size of the cards you will be printing, there
				will be up to six choices. The layouts shown in the figure above
				are for bureau sized cards on letter sized (8Â½ by 11 inch) paper.
				The cards are shown in white with a blue edge and the paper
				or cardstock is shown in light pink so you can see how the cards
				are layed out. For this tutorial, select the layout at the top
				left.</para>
				<para>The Options group box on the right of the Print Settings
				dialog controls certain print options:</para>
				<para>The Print Card Outlines checkbox controls whether a black
				line is printed around the edges of each card. Printing the card
				outline makes it easier to cut the cards out of the cardstock.</para>
				<para>If the number of cards to be printed does not exactly
				equal the number of pages to be printed multiplied by the number
				of cards per page, then a portion of the last page would be
				wasted. In this tutorial for example, four cards would be printed
				at three cards per page. In order not to waste a portion of the
				cardstock, you may print "blank" cards to fill the rest of the
				page. These blank cards contain no QSO information; you may enter
				this information using a pen at a later time. Printing or not
				printing these blank cards is controlled by the Fill Last Page
				With Blank Cards checkbox.</para>
				<para>Unless you selected a borderless page size, then your printer
				will not print to the edge of the cardstock, but will leave margins
				of different sizes around the edges of the cardstock when you
				print the cards. Because you will be printing multiple cards
				per page, the cards would have unequal, unprinted margins along one or
				more sides of each card. To create equal sized margins around the
				edges of each card, check the Set Card Margins to Printer Page
				Margins checkbox. Depending on card layout that you choose, this
				checkbox may be checked or unchecked. For this tutorial, make
				sure that this checkbox is checked.</para>
				<para>Please note: if you are using a printer that does not
				provide its margin information, this checkbox will be unchecked
				and disabled, so you will not be able to check it. After you
				clicked the "Print" button on the Print dialog, a message dialog
				will have been displayed to inform you of this.</para>

			<title>Introduction to Macros</title>
			<para>Macros add a powerful feature to HamQSLer by providing
			<emphasis>active</emphasis> text. For every macro there is text
			that is displayed on the card in design view, and text that is
			inserted when the cards are printed. These macros may be used
			in any text item and also in the confirming text user preference.
			If you followed the Getting
			Started Tutorial, you got your first glimpse of Count Macro.</para>
			<para>This discussion will focus on macros used in text items;
			using macros in the confirming text user preference are similar
			to macros within the Text and Macros dialog which you
			will see shortly.</para>
			<para>The image below shows the text area in a text item properties
			panel. If there are no macros used in the text item, then this
			is what you will see: a text box for editing the static text,
			and a button labeled "Macros". If there are macros
			being used in the text item, then only the button is visible.</para>

			<para>Clicking the button opens the Text and Macros dialog, shown

			<para>To add a macro, place the mouse cursor over the colored
			rectangle that contains the "Static Text" and click the right 
			mouse button to bring up the macros
			context menu, shown below.</para>

					</imageobject>
				</mediaobject>
			</figure>
			<para>The context menu permits you to add a macro either before
			or after the static text or macro colored rectangle you opened the
			context menu over. There are a few things to notice:</para>
			<simplelist>
				<member>The Delete menu item cannot be selected when only
				one static text or macro exists.</member>
				<member>Static text items cannot be inserted next to another
				static text item, only next to macros.</member>
			</simplelist>
			<para>The image below shows the dialog after a Manager Macro has
			been inserted after the static text item, and all expanders have
			been expanded.</para>

			</figure>
			<para>Every macro has a section called "Design Text". This is
			the text that is displayed on the card in design mode. In the
			Getting Started Tutorial, this is the "&lt;S&gt;" in both the confirming
			text in the QSOs Box and in the salutation text item. Other sections
			are specific to the macros. At print time, the Manager Macro
			will place the contents of the Manager field for the QSO on the
			card, or the No Manager Text if the Manager field is empty.
			Any of these fields may be blank.</para>
			<para>Macros may be inserted inside macros anywhere that a static
			text field is allowed. For example, you could add a macro inside
			the Design Text or No Manager Text fields of the Manager Macro,
			but you could not add another macro at the same level as the
			Design Text or No Manager Text sections. While macros may theoretically
			be added to any depth, you should take great care with this facility
			as keeping track of the macro level becomes increasingly difficult
			as macros are added to greater depths.</para>
			<para>The remaining sections in this chapter describe each macro.</para>

		<section>
			<title>ADIF Macro</title>
			<para>An ADIF Macro prints the contents of an ADIF field on a
			card if the field exists and is not an empty string; otherwise,
			it prints user specified text. The image below shows a view of 
			the ADIF Macro as it would first appear after adding in the
			Text and Macros dialog.</para>
			<figure xml:id="adifmacro">

						<imagedata fileref="images/adifmacro.png" />
					</imageobject>
				</mediaobject>
			</figure>
			<para>The contents of an ADIF field may change from one QSO to
			the next. Because of this, you will normally want to print a
			different card every time the contents of the ADIF field changes.
			Checking the "Separate Cards By This ADIF Field" checkbox will
			do this; if you do not check this checkbox, then the contents
			of the ADIF field from the first QSO that is printed on the card
			will be added to the card.</para>
			<para>Add the name of the ADIF field for this macro to the ADIF
			Field text box. Standard ADIF fields are defined in the ADIF
			standard, available at <link xlink:href="http://www.adif.org">
			http://www.adif.org</link>. Be sure to select the
			version of the standard that corresponds to the version specified by
			your logging application. In addition to the fields defined in the
			standard, your logger may also export application specific fields.
			See the documentation for your logger for these fields.</para>
			<para>The field name is not case sensitive; for example, "CALL",
			"call", and "CalL" are all valid.</para>
			<para>The No Field Text section contains the text that would
			be printed if either the ADIF field does not exist for the QSOs,
			or the value of the field is an empty string.</para>
			<tip>
				<para>Do you operate using a number of different callsigns?
				If you do and your exported ADIF file contains the 
				STATION_CALLSIGN field, then you could replace the static
				callsign text item with an ADIF Macro for the STATION_CALLSIGN.
				Be sure to check the "Separate Cards By This ADIF Field"
				checkbox. Then a single card can be used for every one of
				your callsigns.</para>
			</tip>
			<tip>
				<para>QSL bureaus prefer that the callsign of the station
				that is to receive a QSL card be written in the upper right
				or left corner of the back or front of the card. You could
				do this by adding a new text item, positioning it appropriately,
				and including text such as "To: " as well as an ADIF macro
				for the CALL field.</para>
				<para>HamQSLer does not easily support printing
				this on the opposite side of the card from other text and
				the QSOs Box, but if you properly design your card, it can
				be placed on the same side as these items and still be very
				visible to the sorters at the QSL bureaus.</para>
			</tip>
			<tip>
				<para>You could customize the confirming text in the QSOs
				Box or the salutation text item to contain mode information.
				For example, your salutation could be "Thanks for the CW
				QSOs. 73, " for CW QSOs and so forth.</para>
			</tip>

		<section>
			<title>ADIF Exists Macro</title>
			<para>The ADIF Exists Macro prints user specified text if the
			ADIF field exists for a QSO and its contents are not an empty 
			string, and
			prints a different user specified text if the field either does
			not exist or the field contents are empty. The image below shows 
			a view of the ADIF Exists Macro.</para>
			<para>This image shows the various sections
			as they would be immediately after the macro has been added to

			<para>Enter the text that you want displayed if the ADIF field
			doesn't exist in the Field Doesn't Exist Text section.</para>
			<tip>
				<para>If you are a contester, you could use this macro to
				modify the salutation to say "Thanks for the contest QSOs.
				73, " for cards for your contest QSOs and not include the
				"contest" word for non-contest QSOs.</para>

		<section>
			<title>Count Macro</title>
			<para>The Count Macro specifies text that is to be printed when
			the condition is met and text that is printed when the condition
			is not met. When a card with QSOs in the QSOs Box is printed,
			the condition is tested against the number of QSOs being  printed
			in the QSOs Box. If a blank card (i.e. a card without QSOs) is
			printed, the condition is tested against the max QSOs count for
			the QSOs Box. This matches the number of blank rows printed on
			the card.</para>
			<para>The image below shows a view of the Count Macro. This image 
			shows the various sections
			as they would be immediately after the macro has been added to
			the Text and Macros dialog.</para>

			<para>The Condition radio buttons set the test that is to be
			performed against the Condition Value. The conditions are:</para>
			<simplelist>
				<member>Equals,</member>
				<member>Less than, and</member>
				<member>Greater than.</member>
			</simplelist>
			<para>The Condition Value is the number of QSOs or the max QSOs
			value for the QSOs Box. This value may be set to any value between
			1 and 15, and matches the range of values allowed for max QSOs.</para>
			<para>Enter the text you want to be displayed on the card in
			design mode in the Design Text section.</para>
			<para>Enter the text that is to be printed when the condition
			is met in the True Text section. This is the "&lt;S&gt;" text that is
			displayed in the confirming text and the salutation text as set
			in the original user preferences.</para>
			<para>Enter the text that is to be printed when the condition
			is not met in the False Text section.</para>
			<para>You may reverse conditions by reversing the True Text and
			False Text texts.</para>
			<tip>
				<para>The confirming text in the QSOs Box and the salutation
				text defined in the original user preferences (set when you
				start HamQSLer for the first time) each contain a Count Macro.
				As used there, the design text is "&lt;S&gt;", "s" is printed when
				the number of QSOs (or the max QSOs count for blank cards)
				is greater than 1 and no text is printed when the number of
				QSOs is 1.</para>
				<para>It would appear that the use of this macro is limited
				to cases such as this.</para>

			<title>Manager Macro</title>

<para><emphasis role="bold">0. PREAMBLE</emphasis></para>
<para>
The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other 
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure
everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or 
without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. 
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way 
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
 modifications made by others.</para>
<para>
This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works 
of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It 
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license 
designed for free software.</para>
<para>
We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free 
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program
 should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software 
 does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be 
 used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it 
 is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally 
 for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.</para>
 
<para><emphasis role="bold">1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</emphasis></para>
<para>
This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that 
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be 
distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a 
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that 
work under the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers 
to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and 
is addressed as "you". You accept the license if you copy, modify or 
distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.
</para>
<para>
A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the 
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with 
modifications and/or translated into another language.
</para>
<para>
A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of 
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the 
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject 
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly 
within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a 
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any 
mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical 
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, 
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.
</para>
<para>
The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that 
says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does
not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be 
designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant 
Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then 
there are none.</para>
<para>
The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the 
Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at 
most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.</para>
<para>
A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, 
represented in a format whose specification is available to the general 
public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly 
with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic 
paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, 
and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic 
translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text 
formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose 
markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage 
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format 
is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy 
that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</para>
<para>
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII 
without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML 
using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, 
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of 
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats 
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by 
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or 
processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated 
HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output 
purposes only.</para>
<para>
The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus 
such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this 
License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which
do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the
most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning 
of the body of the text.</para>
<para>
The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of 
the Document to the public.</para>
<para>
A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose 
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following 
text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a 
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements", 
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of
such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a 
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.</para>
<para>
The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which 
states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty 
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, 
but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that 
these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the 
meaning of this License.</para>

<para><emphasis role="bold">2. VERBATIM COPYING</emphasis></para>
<para>
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either 
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the 
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to
the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other 
conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use 
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying
of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept 
compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough 
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
</para>
<para>
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and 
you may publicly display copies.</para>

<para><emphasis role="bold">3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</emphasis></para>
<para>
If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have 
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the 
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the 
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back 
cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the 
publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title 
with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add 
other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited 
to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and 
satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other 
respects.</para>
<para>
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit 
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit 
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent 
pages.</para>
<para>
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering 
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent 
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
computer-network location from which the general network-using public 
has access to download using public-standard network protocols a 
complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If 
you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when 
you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location 
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque 
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to 
the public.</para>
<para>x
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the 
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give 
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
</para>
<para><emphasis role="bold">4. MODIFICATIONS</emphasis></para>
<para>
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the

<para>
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices
that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from 
the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these 
sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of 
Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These 
titles must be distinct from any other section titles.</para>
<para>
You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains 
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various partiesâfor
example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by
an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.</para>
<para>
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a 
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list 
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover 
Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements
made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text 
for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by 
the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; 
but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the 
previous publisher that added the old one.</para>
<para>
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License 
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or 
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</para>

<para><emphasis role="bold">5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</emphasis></para>
<para>
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this 
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified 
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the 
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and 
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license
notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.</para>
<para>
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and 
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single 
copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but 
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding
at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or 
publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the 
same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections 
in the license notice of the combined work.</para>
<para>
In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History" in 
the various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History"; 
likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", and any 
sections Entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections Entitled 
"Endorsements".</para>

<para><emphasis role="bold">6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</emphasis></para>
<para>
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this 
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in 
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for 
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.</para>
<para>
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this 
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all 
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.</para>

<para><emphasis role="bold">7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
</emphasis></para>
<para>
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or 
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting
from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the 
compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the 
Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the
other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works 
of the Document.</para>
<para>
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies
of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the 
entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers 
that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic 
equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise 
they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.
</para>
<para><emphasis role="bold">8. TRANSLATION</emphasis></para>
<para>
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute 
translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing 
Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from 
their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all
Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these 
Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and 
all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, 
provided that you also include the original English version of this 
License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In 
case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version 
of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will 
prevail.</para>
<para>
If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements", 
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its
Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.
</para>
<para><emphasis role="bold">9. TERMINATION</emphasis></para>
<para>
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except 
as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically 
terminate your rights under this License.</para>
<para>
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license 
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, 
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates 
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to 
notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days 
after the cessation.</para>
<para>
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated 
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by 
some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice 
of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, 
and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the 
notice.</para>
<para>
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the 
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under 
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently 
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does 
not give you any rights to use it.</para>

</emphasis></para>
<para>
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the 
GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
</para>
<para>
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If
the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this 
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of 
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or 
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the 
Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version 
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not 
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies 
that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be 
used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version 
permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

<para>
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any World
Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides 
prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that
anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A "Massive Multiauthor

	                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.
