		<para>In this tutorial, we will create and save a simple 
		card, load QSOs from an ADIF file and select the QSOs to 
		print, and finally, print the QSOs.</para>
		<para>The first steps are to become familiar with
		the <link linkend="splashscreen">HamQSLer splash screen

		<para>The first time that you start HamQSLer, only the QSOs 
		function tab
		will be shown. After you have created one or more cards, and
		depending on certain user preferences, there may be an additional
		tab for each card the next time that you start the program.</para>
		<para>The function tabs select the view that is displayed in 
		the Work Area. The QSOs tab shows the loaded QSOs for which 
		cards may be printed. The QSOs panel, shown in the image below, 
		contains 5 QSOs that have been loaded from an ADIF file, the 
		Sort Cards Panel, and the QSOs filters tabs. The Sort Cards 
		Panel allows you to sort the cards by date and time, by callsign, 
		or by a 
		combination of QSL bureau and manager or callsign. There are
		four QSOs filters tab, each of which contain filters
		for selecting QSOs. The four filters are:</para>

			<para>There are a number of properties related to text items;
			we will look at each of them in turn.</para>
			<para>The font dropdown box contains all of the fonts registered
			with your operating system. The font that is currently
			selected is the font that you selected in the user
			preferences earlier in this tutorial. Select a different
			font. The callsign on the card is now displayed in that
			font. Notice that only this text changed font, not the other
			text items.</para>
			<para>The text may be displayed in Black, Bold, or Normal 
			weight by selecting the weight from the Font Weight combo box.
			Italic or Normal style may be selected by checking and 
			unchecking the
			Italic checkbutton. Try this. For the callsign
			text, the default is normal style and Black weight.</para>
			<para>The size dropdown box contains a number of predefined
			font sizes (in device independent units which are equal
			to ¾ of a point). 72 is the default value for callsigns.
			You can select any of the sizes
			directly from the list, or edit the size box to enter any
			size that you want. When editing the value, use "." 
			as the decimal separator. Try entering a character other than
			a number or ".". Note the beep emitted by your computer to
			indicate that you entered an invalid character.Now select 
			the font size that you want.</para>
			<para>The color button (the button with the black rectangle)
			shows the color that the text is displayed in. Click on this
			button to open the color picker dialog, shown below.</para>
			<figure xml:id="colorpicker">
				<title>Color Picker Dialog</title>
				<mediaobject>
					<imageobject>
						<imagedata fileref="images/colorpicker.png" />
					</imageobject>
				</mediaobject>
			</figure>
			<para>
			The color picker lets you set a color in a number of
			different ways. For example, you can select one of the basic
			or custom colors shown in swatches on the left side of the
			dialog, or you can select a custom color by clicking in the
			rainbow on the right side of the dialog and then adjusting
			the slider to the right of the rainbow to adjust the luminance
			value. Alternatively you may enter hue, saturation and luminance
			values or red, green and blue values in the entry boxes below
			the rainbow. To save as a custom color for later use in the
			program, click on the "Add to Custom Colors" button.</para>
			<para>For this tutorial, a bright orange works best. Set
			red to 255, green to 128, and blue to 0. Save this as a
			custom color because we will be using it again, then click 
			the OK button.
			This closes the color picker dialog. The button in the 
			text item properties panel now displays an orange rectangle,
			and the callsign text on the card is displayed in orange.</para>
			<para>The group box labeled Text holds an edit box containing
			the text of the callsign. Make some changes to the text and
			note that the changes are immediately reflected on the card.
			Reset the text to your callsign.</para>
			<para>Ignore the "Macros" button for now.</para>
			<para>The Checkboxes group box contains four controls, a
			checkbutton for adding a checkbox in front of the text,
			a checkbutton for adding a checkbox after the text, a slider
			for adjusting the thickness of the lines making up the checkboxes,
			and a slider to set the size of the checkboxes as a percentage
			of the height of the text. Adjust each of these controls to see the effect
			they have. The line thickness and check box ratio sliders only
			have an effect when at least
			one of the checkbuttons is checked. Note that the checkboxes
			are displayed in the same color as the text. Uncheck both
			checkbuttons.</para>
			<para>Move the mouse cursor over the callsign text on the
			card. The mouse cursor will change to the move cursor. Press
			and hold the left mouse button, and drag the text to be near
			the top left corner of the card, then release the mouse 
			button.</para>
			<para>Deselect the callsign text and select the text with
			your name and QTH. Change the color of the text to the same
			orange color as the callsign. Adjust the postion of the
			text so that the top of the top line of the text is in
			line with the top of the callsign text. Position the text
			so that it is to the right of the callsign.Deselect the 
			text item.</para>
			<para>Now look at the salutation text on the card. Note
			the text is "Thanks for the QSO$. 73, ". The "&lt;S&gt;" characters
			are a placeholder for a Count Macro. We will look at this
			macro in a moment.</para>
			<para>Select the salutation text item. In the text item
			properties panel, note that Text group box contains only 
			a Macros button. Click on this
			button to open the Text and Macros dialog.</para>
			<para>The Text and Macros dialog will contain three main group boxes:
			the groupbox at the top of the dialog, labelled "Static Text",
			contains a text edit box with the text "Thanks for the QSO",
			The second main group box, labelled "Count Macro" will be discussed
			in a moment. The third main group box located at the bottom of
			the dialog is labelled "Static Text" and contains a text edit
			box with the text ". 73," in it. The dialog will look like 
			the image below.</para>

			<para>The Count Macro group box
			contains controls for the contents of a Count Macro. A Count
			Macro displays text based on the number of QSOs rows that
			are printed in the QSOs Box for cards with no QSOs, and 
			the number of QSOs printed for cards with QSOs. This count 
			macro is set up to print "s" when the QSOs count is greater
			than one, print nothing when the QSOs count is 1, and to
			display
			"&lt;S&gt;" on the card in design mode. Each of these values, and
			the condition may be modified. See the 
			<link linkend="macros">Macros chapter</link> for
			more information. We will not make any changes to the
			count macro or its text in this tutorial.</para>
			<para>Change the color of the text to the same orange color
			as the other text items, and make any adjustments to the
			position of the text that you would like. Deselect the salutation
			text item.</para>

			<para>The text that is displayed in the Qsos Box (e.g. the
			confirming text (in the top line of the box, the text for
			each column header, and the text that is displayed in the 
			QSL column, not yet shown on the card) is determined by 
			user preferences and is fixed when the card is first created.
			See the <link linkend="settinguserprefs">User 
			Preferences</link> chapter for details on setting these
			values.</para>
			<section>
				<title>Setting QSOs and Fields Properties</title>
				<para>Let's look at each property. The Show Manager checkbox
				when checked adds the text "via ZZZZZZ" to the confirmation
				line in design mode, and will replace "ZZZZZZ" with the
				other station's QSL manager if one exists and is included
				in the Manager column of the QSOs printed on the card. We
				will look at this later when we select the QSOs to be printed.
				If no manager exists, the text, including "via" is not
				printed. Check this checkbox as we will be using it later.</para>
				<para>Below the Show Manager checkbox are two radio buttons,
				one labeled "Show Band Column" and the other labeled 
				"Show Frequency Column". When
				you create a card, the "Show Band Column" radio button 
				is selected by
				default. These two radio buttons determine whether the 
				Qsos Box displays a band column or a frequency column. Click
				the "Show Frequency Column" button. 
				Note that the Band column header
				has changed to MHz and that the size of the various columns
				have adjusted themselves.</para>
				<para>What happens if you select the Band radio button but
				your logging program only logs frequency? When the ADIF file
				containing the QSOs is loaded, or when you manually input
				QSOs, a band field will be generated
				for each QSO, with the band corresponding to the band
				containing the logged frequency.</para>
				<para>And what happens if you select the Frequency radio
				button but the QSO only has a band field and not a frequency
				field? When each card is printed, a default frequency for
				that band is substituted. The default frequency for each
				band may be set in the user preferences.</para>
				<para>Make sure that the "Show Band Column" radio button 
				is selected.</para>
				<para>The QSL Pse/Tnx checkbox controls the visibility of
				the QSL column in the Qsos Box. When a card is first created,
				this checkbox is checked. Uncheck the checkbox; note that
				the column labeled "QSL" at the left of the
				Qsos Box has been removed, and the other columns have been 
				resized. The values
				printed in this column depend on the value of the QSL_RCVD
				ADIF field for each QSO. If the field contains "Y" indicating
				that a QSL card has been received confirming this QSO, then
				the text "Tnx" is printed in the column for that QSO. If
				the column contains any other value, the text "Pse" is printed
				in the column. "Tnx" and "Pse" are default values; they may
				be changed in user preferences.</para>
				<para>Make sure that the checkbox is checked before continuing
				with this tutorial.</para>
				<para>The Date Format dropdown box contains three values:
				</para>
				<simplelist type="vert">
					<member>YYYY-MM-DD</member>
					<member>DD-MMM-YY</member>
					<member>DD-MM-YY</member>
				</simplelist>
				<para>The value selected determines both the text that is
				displayed in the date column, and the format of the date printed
				for each QSO. Change to a different value to see the effect on
				the Qsos Box. Finally, set this value to YYYY-MM-DD for this
				tutorial.</para>
				<para>The Max Qsos control specifies the maximum number of
				QSOs that may be printed on the card. The control is an
				editable spinner; you may change values by clicking on the
				up or down triangles on the right side of the control, or
				you may directly edit the value. Valid values are between
				1 and 15. Try multiple values to see how the Qsos Box changes.
				</para>
				<para>The default value when you create a new card is 4.
				There is no way to change this default.</para>
				<para>Finally, set this value to 2.</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Setting Line and Text Properties</title>
				<para>There are three color buttons. Each button opens the
				color picker dialog to allow you to select a color. The three
				colors control the color of the lines and text in the Qsos
				Box, the color of the callsign in the confirming text, and
				the color of the manager in the confirming text. Set the
				line and text color to orange (red=255, green=128, blue=0),
				and set the manager color to green (red=0, green=255,
				blue=0). The orange text is a bit hard to read but we will
				fix that in a moment.</para>
				<para>The Font Size dropdown box contains values between
				8.0 and 14.0. This sets the size of the font in the QSOs
				Box. Try different values. For the 2 QSOs that we have set
				as the maximum, a value of 12.0 points is good. Smaller 
				values will
				be needed when you select a large Max QSOs value; otherwise
				the box would not fit on the card.</para>
				<para>The Font dropdown box allows you to select the font
				that the text in the Qsos Box is displayed and printed in.
				The initial font selected in the dropdown box is the font
				that you specified as the default QSOs Box font in the
				User Preferences earlier.
				Select a few different fonts and notice how the height of
				the Qsos Box changes. The actual height of a line of text
				in each font will be different, even though the font size
				has not changed.</para>
				<para>Set the font to a value that looks good to you.</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Setting Qsos Box Background Properties</title>
				<para>These properties control the color and the opacity
				(opposite of transparency) of the background of the Qsos
				Box.</para>
				<para>Click on the Color button to display the color picker
				dialog. This dialog may be used to change the color of the
				background of the Qsos Box. Note that any change you make
				is not visible. We will correct that in a moment.</para>
				<para>The opacity slider adjusts the opacity 
				(1 - transparency) of the background. Adjust the slider to
				select values between 0 and 100% to see the effect on the
				Qsos Box.</para>
				<para>When you have finished playing, set the color to black
				(red=0, green=0, blue=0), and set the opacity to 30%. Note
				that the orange text in the Qsos Box is now much more visible,
				and that a considerable amount of the detail in the 
				background image shows through.</para>

			<title>Default Printer and Print Options Properties</title>
			<para>Click on the tab labeled "sample.qslx" to redisplay the
			card that you designed earlier.</para>
			<para>Select the Print Cards... menu item from the Cards

			</figure>
			<para>Select the printer you would use for printing the cards,
			and then click the "Preferences" button to set printing preferences
			such as print quality and paper size. For now, select a paper
			size of either letter or A4. Do not set Portrait or
			Landscape mode because this setting is overridden later. Now click the
			OK button to close the Printing Preferences dialog.</para>
			<para>Click the "Print" button to close the Print dialog and
			open the Print Settings dialog, shown below.</para>
			<figure xml:id="printsettingsdialog">

				<mediaobject>
					<imageobject>
						<imagedata fileref="images/printsettingsdialog.png" />
					</imageobject>
				</mediaobject>
			</figure>
			<para>The card layout group box on the left of the dialog allows
			you to select how the cards are printed on the page. Depending
			on the size of the paper you selected in the Printing Preferences
			dialog and the size of the cards you will be printing, there
			will be up to six choices. The layouts shown in the figure above
			are for bureau sized cards on letter sized (8½ by 11 inch) paper.
			The cards are shown in white with a blue edge and the paper
			or cardstock is shown in light pink so you can see how the cards
			are layed out. For this tutorial, select the layout at the top
			left.</para>
			<para>The Options group box on the right of the Print Settings
			dialog controls certain print options:</para>
			<para>The Print Card Outlines checkbox controls whether a black
			line is printed around the edges of each card. Printing the card
			outline makes it easier to cut the cards out of the cardstock.</para>
			<para>If the number of cards to be printed does not exactly
			equal the number of pages to be printed multiplied by the number
			of cards per page, then a portion of the last page would be
			wasted. In this tutorial for example, four cards would be printed
			at three cards per page. In order not to waste a portion of the
			cardstock, you may print "blank" cards to fill the rest of the
			page. These blank cards contain no QSO information; you may enter
			this information using a pen at a later time. Printing or not
			printing these blank cards is controlled by the Fill Last Page
			With Blank Cards checkbox.</para>
			<para>Unless you selected a borderless page size, then your printer
			will not print to the edge of the cardstock, but will leave margins
			of different sizes around the edges of the cardstock when you
			print the cards. Because you will be printing multiple cards
			per page, the cards would have unequal, unprinted margins along one or
			more sides of each card. To create equal sized margins around the
			edges of each card, check the Set Card Margins to Printer Page
			Margins checkbox. Depending on card layout that you choose, this
			checkbox may be checked or unchecked. For this tutorial, make
			sure that this checkbox is checked.</para>
			<para>Please note: if you are using a printer that does not
			provide its margin information, this checkbox will be unchecked
			and disabled, so you will not be able to check it. After you
			clicked the "Print" button on the Print dialog, a message dialog
			will have been displayed to inform you of this.</para>
			<para>To print the cards you would click the "Print" button.
			Since you probably do not want to waste the paper and ink
			on this first card, click the "Preview" button. This
			opens the print preview dialog.</para>

			<para>There is a toolbar at the top of the dialog. The buttons
			on this toolbar allow you to control the magnification of each page
			and to specify whether you want to display one or two pages at 
			a time. A scrollbar on the right side of the dialog allows
			you to scroll through the various pages to be printed.</para>
			<para>On the first page, the first card contains the two QSOs
			to VA3JNO with VA3HJ as the manager. The second card contains
			a single QSO with VA3JNO, and the third card contains a single
			QSO with 5C5CW. If the maximum number of QSOs on a card
			had been set to 1, only a single QSO would have been printed
			on each card.</para>
			<para>Note that on the cards with one QSO, the confirming
			text in the QSOs Box is "Confirming 2-Way QSO with ...", and
			the salutation text is "Thanks for the QSO. 73,". On the
			card with two QSOs the texts are "Confirming 2-Way QSOs
			with..." and "Thanks for the QSOs. 73,". The inclusion and
			exclusion of the "s" on "QSO" is controlled by a Count Macro.
			See <link linkend="macros">Macros</link> for more information.
			</para>
			<para>Now view the second page of cards. The first card is 
			for the QSO with CG3JNO, and the last two cards contain a
			QSOs Box with two empty lines. These cards are printed because
			you checked the "Fill Last Page With Blank Cards" checkbox.</para>
			<para>Every card is surrounded by a black line on all sides
			because you checked the "Print Card Outlines" checkbox.</para>
			<para>Close the print preview dialog. Go back and try the
			various print options settings combinations to see the effect
			that each setting has.</para>
			<para>If, after viewing the pages to be printed in the Print
			Preview dialog, you want to print the pages, you must close
