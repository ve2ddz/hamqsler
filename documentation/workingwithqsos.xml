	<title>Working With QSOs</title>
	<para>The majority of <literal>HamQSLer</literal> users make use of a QSO logging program;
	logging programs
	vary in functionality from simple, basically equivalent to a computerized paper log, up
	to complex programs that track awards, monitor and control transmitters and receivers, 
	interact with digital modems, and communicate with electronic QSLing services such as 
	Logbook of the World
	and eQSL. The one common component that exists in all modern logging programs is the
	ability to exchange data with other programs using Amateur Data Interchange Format (ADIF).</para>
	<para>The ADIF standard has existed for many years, and has gone through many changes over
	that time. The standard is very flexible in that it specifies the various fields that can
	be contained in a QSO record, but does not mandate that all or even a specific subset of the fields
	is required in every record. The one requirement that ADIF makes for any program that claims
	compatibility with any version of the standard is that it must accept as input ADIF files that were
	generated to any version of the ADIF standard that preceeds the standard that the receiving program
	claims compatibility with.</para>
	<caution>
		<para><literal>HamQSLer</literal> attempts to follow the latest available version
		of the ADIF standard but in a few 
		places it may not be able to support esoteric features. In general, 
		this does not cause a problem because 
		<literal>HamQSLer</literal> is only interested in a few of the fields
		that appear in QSO records in an ADIF file. Users may make use of
		macros to access other fields.</para>
	</caution>
	<caution>
		<para><literal>HamQSLer</literal> validates QSO records to ensure that they contain 
		at least a minimum set of
		data: start date and time for the QSO, frequency or band used, mode and/or submode used for the QSO,
		and the callsign of the station contacted. Validity checking is performed on each
		field within a QSO. For example, if a frequency is specified, it must be within
		the ADIF specified ham bands, and the callsign must be valid. Full information on the checking
		that <literal>HamQSLer</literal> does to each QSO record being input is provided in 
		<link linkend="qsoandfieldvalidation"><emphasis role='underline'>Appendix D</emphasis></link>.</para>
	</caution>
	<para>A number of users may still keep paper logs. <literal>HamQSLer</literal>
	provides a dialog for manually inputting
	QSOs one at a time. This facility may be used as the only means of inputting QSOs, or may be
	used in addition to loading QSO data from ADIF files.</para>
	<para>This chapter discusses importing QSO data from ADIF files, inputting QSOs using the input
	dialog, sorting the QSOs and selecting QSOs to be printed on QSL cards.</para>
	<section>
		<title>Loading and Saving QSOs</title>
		<para>In order to work with QSOs, including loading and saving them, the QSOs tab in the
		main window of the program must be selected. When the QSOs tab is selected, the QSOs dropdown
		menu becomes active, along with the menu items that are valid at that time. The menu items
		are:</para>
		<itemizedlist spacing='compact'>
			<listitem>
				<para>Input QSOs... - this opens an input QSO dialog for entering QSOs manually.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Import QSOs... - this opens an Open File dialog to select an ADIF file to import
				QSOs from. Any QSOs which may have already been loaded into 
				<literal>HamQSLer</literal> are removed
				before the new QSOs are loaded.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Add QSOs... - this opens an Open File dialog to select an ADIF file to import
				QSOs from. These QSOs are added to any QSOs that may already be loaded into the
				program.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Clear QSOs - this deletes any QSOs that are loaded into the program.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Export QSOs... - this opens a File Save dialog to save the loaded QSOs to an
				ADIF file.</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		<para>Each of these menu items is discussed below.</para>
		<section>
			<title>Inputting QSOs</title>
			<para>QSOs may be input manually by selecting the Input QSOs... menu item. Selecting
			this menu item opens the Input QSO dialog as shown in the image below.</para>

			</figure>
			<para>The dialog contains a number of text boxes and dropdown boxes that allow the
			user to enter data about a QSO. This dialog allows entry of only those fields that
			are used normally by <literal>HamQSLer</literal>.</para>
			<tip>
				<para>If additional QSO fields are required, then the user
				should use an appropriate QSO logging program, then export the QSOs to an ADIF file,
				and import that file into <literal>HamQSLer</literal>.</para>
			</tip>
			<para>The callsign, manager, start date, start time, and frequency fields are
			standard text boxes. All of the standard text editing methods apply to these
			fields.</para>
			<para>Modes are selected from the mode dropdown box. A mode may be selected by:</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Clicking the dropdown box. This opens
					the list of modes; a mode may be selected by clicking on it, or by pressing
					the up and down arrow keys to highlight a mode, and then pressing the
					Enter key. Instead of selecting a mode with the mouse or the up and down
					arrow keys, you may enter the mode using the alphabetic and numeric keys
					on the keyboard. You should continue to enter keys until the desired mode is
					highlighted, then press Enter to select the mode. As an alternative to
					entering the mode by spelling it out, the user may press the first letter
					of the mode multiple times. This will cycle through all modes that begin
					with that letter. </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Moving focus to the dropdown box by tabbing
					to it, then using the up and down arrow keys on the keyboard to highlight the
					mode, and pressing the Enter key to select it. The dropdown box does not open,
					but the selected mode changes with each press of the up or down arrow keys.
					Instead of moving through the modes using the arrow keys, you may enter
					the mode using the alphabetic and numeric keys on the keyboard. As each key is
					pressed, the mode that most closely matches the entered keys is selected.
					For example, pressing "C" will select the first mode beginning with "C". 
					If you then
					press "L", CLO is selected because it is the first mode that begins with
					"CL". If you press the same letter several times, then the selection will
					cycle through all of the modes that begin with that letter.</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<para>Once a mode has been selected, the submode combo box is loaded with the list of
			submodes that correspond to the selected mode. The submode may be selected using any of the
			methods outlined above for selecting a mode.</para>
			<para>Not all possible submodes for each mode are enumerated in the submode combo box, only
			the common ones. This combo box is editable; you may enter a different value using the
			keyboard.</para>
			<caution>
				<para>If you enter a submode using the keyboard, then export the QSOs to an ADIF file and
				import the file into another program, the receiving program may not accept
				the submode. The ADIF standard does not specify that any program must accept all submode
				values; how that program handles submode values not enumerated in the standard is up
				to the program's author.</para>
			</caution>
			<para>The band dropdown box contains a list of all valid amateur radio bands. A
			band may be selected by using any of the methods outlined above for selecting
			an item from the mode dropdown.</para>
			<para>The QSL Rcvd and Sent fields are preloaded with the default value
			('No") as defined in the ADIF standard. The Sent Via field is set
			to "Bureau" because that is the value that is assumed by <literal>HamQSLer</literal>
			if one of the
			other values is not selected. All valid values for these three fields are
			loaded in the
			dropdown lists. You may select any of the values in the dropdown boxes using the 
			instructions
			provided for selecting a mode, above.</para>

		<para>The Add+ button validates the contents of the QSO fields, then adds the QSO to the 
		list of QSOs in the QSOs view, and deletes the
		contents of all boxes in the dialog to prepare for entry of the next QSO. The OK button

			<title>Validating a QSO Input via the Input QSO Dialog</title>
			<para>In the image of the Input QSO dialog, several of the text boxes are 
			outlined in red. See
			<link linkend="errorhandlingandlogging"><emphasis role='underline'>Error
			Handling and Logging</emphasis></link> for a discussion
			of input validation and the reason that these text boxes are outlined.</para>
			<para>The value entered into the callsign text box must be a valid callsign. A callsign
			is determined to be valid if it matches one of the following:</para>
			<itemizedlist spacing='compact'>
				<listitem>
					<para>One or two letters followed by one or more numbers followed by
					one or more letters.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>A single number followed by one or two letters followed by one or
					more numbers followed by one or more letters.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>A callsign that do not match the formats listed above. A list of valid
					non-standard callsigns is maintained and read by the program. A non-standard
					callsign must be in the list to be considered valid. Some examples of valid
					non-standard callsigns are BX100, LM9L40Y, and OEH20.</para>
					<para>Any non-standard callsign that is shown in the ARRL DX bulletin,
					issued weekly, is added to the list. 
					<literal>HamQSLer</literal> users may request that a
					callsign be added to the list by filing an enhancement issue. See the website
					for instructions.</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<para>The callsign may have a leading qualifier followed by "/" and one or more
			trailing qualifiers, with each trailing qualifier preceeded by "/".
			A leading qualifier is
			always a country or territory identifier. The trailing qualifier is typically
			an indicator about the operation, such as /M for mobile, /MM for maritime mobile,
			/AM for aeronautical mobile, /P for portable, /QRP for QRP, and so forth. For
			United States / Canada reciprocal operations, the country/territory identifier
			is appended to the callsign and placed before other trailing qualifiers.
			<literal>HamQSLer</literal> only checks the callsign for validity, and not
			the leading and trailing qualifiers.</para>
			<para>The manager text box must either be empty, or contain a valid callsign with
			no leading or trailing qualifiers.</para>
			<para>The start date must be exactly 8 digits long, be of the form YYYYMMDD and
			be a date between 19300101 and today.</para>
			<para>The start time must be either 4 digits of the form HHMM, or 6 digits of the
			form HHMMSS. The time must be between 0000 and 2359 or between 000000 and 235959.</para>
			<para>The signal report field accepts any text up to three characters in length. The
			normal values here are RS for analog voice modes, RST for CW and similar modes,
			RSQ for most digital modes, and dB for JT65 and similar modes.</para>
			<caution>
				<para>No validation is performed on the signal report. If you enter text that
				is not representative of "standard" values, the report may not be understood
				by your card's recipient.</para>
			</caution>
			<para>The band and frequency boxes work together, and at least one of these boxes must
			contain a value.</para>
			<para>A frequency may be entered into the frequency text box. The frequency must be
			entered in MHz, and must be within the frequency limits of an ADIF defined band.</para>
			<para>If a band is selected and then a frequency is entered, the frequency is checked
			to ensure that it is within the limits of the selected band. If a frequency is entered first and
			then a band is selected, the band is checked to ensure that the frequency is within that
			band. If the frequency is not within the selected band, then the second value entered
			is shown as being in error.</para>

			<para>Selecting the Call radio button sorts the QSOs by Manager call sign if one is included
			in the QSO,
			then by the other station's call sign, and then by date and time.</para>
			<para>Selecting the Bureau radio button sorts the QSOs by the bureau for the Manager if
			a Manager is included in the QSO or the bureau for the other station if a Manager is not
			included, then by the Manager callsign, the other station's callsign, and then by
			date and time. The QSOs whose Manager (or call sign field) has a valid bureau are sorted
			first in the list, then the QSOs for which there is no bureau are placed after the bureau
			QSOs. QSOs whose QSL_SENT_VIA ADIF field is set to D (Direct) also have their Send Via
			value set to Direct and are therefore sorted with other Direct QSOs.</para>
			<para>The QSOs are sorted as soon as a radio button is selected. The Sort button is enabled
			only when a new QSO is input using the Input QSOs dialog box. When entering QSOs manually,
			the QSOs are added the bottom of the displayed QSOs. The Sort button must be clicked to
			properly sort the QSOs in that case.</para>
